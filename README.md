# ShinyProxy Monitoring

## Summary

This repository provides all resources required for setting up comprehensive
monitoring of ShinyProxy on Kubernetes. The setup uses Loki (together with
promtail) for collecting logs of ShinyProxy, the ShinyProxy Operator and any app
running in ShinyProxy. Prometheus is used for gathering metrics of ShinyProxy
and the apps (i.e. the resources used by the apps). The setup also includes
Grafana, together with **six** dashboards for visualizing all logs and metrics.

The retention of both Loki and Prometheus is set to 90 days.

## Overview of dashboards

### ShinyProxy Usage

- **Datasource:** Prometheus
- **Goal:** provide inside in the *current* usage and performance of ShinyProxy.
- **Provided statistics**:
    - App Startup Time
    - Fine-grained timings
      - Container schedule time (available on Kubernetes): the time needed for
        the container to get assigned to a node. Includes the time to launch a
        new node if the cluster needs to scale-up.
      - Image pull time (available on Docker and Kubernetes)
      - Container initialization time (available on Docker, Docker Swarm and
        Kubernetes): any time needed to start the app which is not part
        of the other metrics
      - Application Startup time (available on Docker, Docker swarm and
        Kubernetes): the time between the start the application process and when
        the app is reachable by ShinyProxy. For example, in the case of the
        Shiny app, this is the time the R process takes to startup and be
        reachable on its webserver.
    - App Usage Time
    - Number of running apps (per app name)
    - Number of logged-in users
    - Number of active users
    - Number of auth failures
    - Number of app start failures
    - Number of app crashes

**Note**: the last three panels of this dashboard can somtimes show a too high
value, e.g. the app crashes dashboard could list two app crashes while in
reality only a single app crashed. This is caused by a limitation
in [Prometheus](https://www.doit.com/making-peace-with-prometheus-rate/).

### ShinyProxy Aggregated Usage

[**Screenshot**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring/master/.github/screenshots/shinyproxy-aggregated-usage.png)

- **Datasource:** Prometheus
- **Goal:** provide inside in the *long-term* usage and performance of
  ShinyProxy.
- **Provided statistics**:
    - Number of times an app has been started (per app)
    - The total time an app has been used (per app)
    - The average time an app is used (per app)

### ShinyProxy logs

[**Screenshot**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring/master/.github/screenshots/shinyproxy-logs.png)

- **Datasource:** Loki
- **Goal:** show the logs of the ShinyProxy server
- **Provided statistics**:
    - Number of warnings
    - Number of errors

**Note:** This requires ShinyProxy to log using
the [JSON format](https://shinyproxy.io/documentation/configuration/#json-logstash-logging).

### ShinyProxy Operator Logs

[**Screenshot**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring/master/.github/screenshots/shinyproxy-operator-logs.png)

- **Datasource:** Loki
- **Goal:** show the logs of the ShinyProxy Operator
- **Provided statistics**:
    - Number of warnings
    - Number of errors

**Note:** promtail is configured such that it recognizes when Java outputs a stack
trace and therefore collects this as a single log message. We could improve and
optimize this by adding an option to the ShinyProxy Operator to log to JSON.

### ShinyProxy App Logs

[**Screenshot (error)**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring/master/.github/screenshots/shinyproxy-app-logs2.png)

- **Datasource:** Loki
- **Goal:** show the logs of any app started by ShinyProxy.
- **Provided statistics**:
    - The time when the app was created. Combined with the filters, this should
      make it easier to find the correct container (id).

**Note:** this dashboard also works when apps are run in different namespaces
than the namespace of the ShinyProxy server. As an example, the Dash application
in ShinyProxy 1 runs in a different namespace.

**Note:** this dashboard also shows parts of the ShinyProxy log that are
relevant for this app.

### ShinyProxy App Resources

[**Screenshot**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openanalytics/shinyproxy-monitoring/master/.github/screenshots/shinyproxy-app-resources.png)

- **Datasource:** Prometheus
- **Goal:** show the resources (CPU, Memory, Network) used by any app started by
  ShinyProxy.
- **Provided statistics**:
    - Current CPU usage
    - CPU Limit and Requests
    - CPU Throttling
    - Current memory usage
    - Memory Limit and Requests
    - Total network traffic (both transmitted and received)

**Note:** this dashboard also works when apps are run in different namespaces
than the namespace of the ShinyProxy server. As an example, the Dash application
in ShinyProxy 1 runs in a different namespace.

## How it works

### Loki + promtail

Both Loki and promtail are used to collect the logs for all relevant dashboards.
The upstream Loki helm chart is used. No tweaks are needed to make it work with
ShinyProxy (although parallel processing was disabled). In contrast, the
configuration of Promtail must be changed to better work with ShinyProxy. See
the [`overlays/promtail/configs/promtail.yaml`](overlays/promtail/configs/promtail.yaml)
file. Some important changes are:

* in the `kubernetes-pods` scrape_config an extra section was added to not
  process any logs of ShinyProxy or the ShinyProxy operator. These logs are
  processed by the `shinyproxy-and-operator-pods` job.

  ```yaml
  - action: drop
    regex: '(shinyproxy)|(shinyproxy-operator)'
    source_labels:
      - app
  ```

* the `kubernetes-pods` scrape_config was changed to process and store some
  ShinyProxy specific annotations. These annotations are added automatically to
  any app started by ShinyProxy. These must be stored in Loki, in order to be
  able to retrieve the logs of an app by specifying the name of the app.
* the `shinyproxy-and-operator-pods` scrape_config was created in order to
  process logs of the ShinyProxy server and ShinyProxy Operator. The pipeline of
  this scrape_config ensures that multiline stacktraces are correctly processed
  as a single log line. Finally, the job also stores some labels relevant for
  ShinyProxy servers.

### Prometheus

The Prometheus setup is based on
the [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/kube-prometheus)
stack.

#### Grafana

The following changes are made to the configuration of Grafana:

* [`overlays/monitoring/configs/dashboards`](overlays/monitoring/configs/dashboards)
  contains the Grafana dashboards.
* [`overlays/monitoring/configs/datasources.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/configs/datasources.yaml)
  configures Prometheus and Loki as a datasource for Grafana.
* [`overlays/monitoring/configs/grafana-dashboardSources.json`](overlays/monitoring/configs/grafana-dashboardSources.json)
  creates a folder for the ShinyProxy dashboards.
* [`overlays/monitoring/patches/grafana.deployment.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/patches/grafana.deployment.yaml)
  adapts the Grafana deployment to use the ShinyProxy dashboards. It also uses the latest
  version of the 8 series of Grafana and adds a PVC for storage.
* [`overlays/monitoring/resources/grafana-storage.pvc.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/resources/grafana-storage.pvc.yaml)
  creates a PVC for Grafana.
* all dashboards are displayed in the timezone of the browser, show the data for
  the last 30 minutes and refresh every 10 seconds. In order to enforce this
  consistency a script is provided to normalize the dashboards.

#### Kube state metrics

[Kube state metrics](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics) is an 
"Add-on agent to generate and expose cluster-level metrics." Information exported
by this add-on is used in the ShinyProxy App Resources dashboard. The
configuration ([`overlays/monitoring/patches/kubeStateMetrics-deployment.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/patches/kubeStateMetrics-deployment.yaml))
is changed to index additional annotations as labels into
the `kube_pod_annotations` metric. This is then used by the dashboard to
populate the variables (or filters) so that users can easily find their pod
based on the name of the app etc.

#### Prometheus

The changes to the Prometheus config are:

- [`overlays/monitoring/patches/prometheus-k8s.clusterrole.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/patches/prometheus-k8s.clusterrole.yaml)
  gives Prometheus additional permissions, to view `ServiceMonitor`, `Pod`
  and `Service` resources on cluster level.
- [`overlays/monitoring/resources/shinyproxy.servicemonitor.yaml`](overlays/monitoring/resources/shinyproxy.servicemonitor.yaml)
  setups a `ServiceMonitor` such that Prometheus collects the metrics of
  ShinyProxy. **Note**: this only collects the metrics of ShinyProxy servers
  running in the `shinyproxy-operator` namespace.

## Getting started

This section demonstrates how to set up this stack in minikube.

1. Start minikube

    ```bash
    minikube start --kubernetes-version='v1.22.11' --addons=metrics-server
    ```

2. Setup ingress (the ingress setup by minikube is too old and causes issues
   with its validating webhook):

    ```bash
    helm upgrade --install ingress-nginx ingress-nginx  --repo https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx   --namespace ingress-nginx --create-namespace --set controller.hostPort.enabled=true
    ```

3. Configure web access to the cluster. First get the IP of minikube using:

   ```bash
   minikube ip
   ```

   Next, add the following entries to `/etc/hosts`, replacing `MINIKUBE_IP` by
   the output of the previous command;

   ```text
   MINIKUBE_IP       grafana.shinyproxy-demo.local
   MINIKUBE_IP       operator-demo.local
   ``` 

4. Set up Loki

    ```bash
    cd overlays/loki
    kustomize build | kubectl apply --server-side -f - 
    cd ../..
    ```

   **Note:** re-run the command if it fails when it cannot find some CRDs.

5. Set up Promtail

    ```bash
    cd overlays/promtail
    kustomize build | kubectl apply --server-side -f - 
    cd ../..
    ```

6. Set up Prometheus and Grafana

    ```bash
    cd overlays/monitoring
    kustomize build | kubectl apply --server-side -f - 
    cd ../..
    ```
   
   **Note:** re-run the command if it fails because it cannot find some CRDs.

7. Set up the demo ShinyProxy Operator deployment:

    ```bash
    cd overlays/shinyproxy
    kustomize build | kubectl apply --server-side -f - 
    cd ../shinyproxy1-app
    kustomize build | kubectl apply --server-side -f - 
     ```

   **Note:** re-run the command if it fails because it cannot find some CRDs.

You can now log in into shinyproxy on <http://operator-demo.local/shinyproxy1>
and <http://operator-demo.local/shinyproxy2> with the users `jack` and `jeff` (both
have as password `password`). You can log into grafana
on <http://grafana.shinyproxy-demo.local>, with the username and password `
admin`.

## Upgrade to 3.1.0

This repository uses the same version numbers as ShinyProxy. Always use the same
version of ShinyProxy and this repository.

In release 3.1.0 of this repository, all components were upgraded. In order to
maintain your logs and metrics, it's important to take the following steps when
updating:

- edit line 50
  of [`overlays/loki/configs/config.yaml`](overlays/loki/configs/config.yaml):
  change the day to be one day after you upgrade Loki. E.g. if you update this
  on `2024-03-25` (25 March 2024), change the date to `2024-03-26`. If you do
  not modify this line, you will no longer be able to access logs from before
  the upgrade. See
  the [Loki docs](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/operations/storage/schema/)
  for more information.
